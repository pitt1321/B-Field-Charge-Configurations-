# Comp-1421-Final-Project
B Field/Moving charge configurations 

Ideas/Goals of this project...
1.) Plotting the path and kinetic energy of a point charge moving through a uniform magnetic field. 
2.) next, through a non-uniform magnetic field(possibly even random). 
3.) then, through an oscillating magnetic field. 
4.) repeat 1,2,& 3 with a conducting ring of uniform charge density and a ring of non-uniform charge density. 
5.) reach goals include: 3d cyclotron simulation, and 3d plotting of everything mentioned prior, and plotting the path of a ring thrown with some angular velocity into a B-field configuration that would incite perpetual rotation.   
6.) Test Cases: 
    Point Charge in uniform B field->>>tweaking parameters 
    ring rotating in its own plane 
    plotting energy to prove that the magnetic field does no work on the oject thrown in
