# Comp-1421-Final-Project
B Field/Moving charge configurations

Goals of this project...

1.) point charge moving in a uniform magnetic field

2.) point charge moving in a non-uniform (possibly random) magnetic field

3.) point charge moving through an oscillating magnetic field

4.) repeat 1,2, & 3 with a ring of uniform charge density and non-uniform
    charge density

5.) for 1,2,3,& 4 plot the path in 3 dimensions

6.) reach goals: 3-d cyclotron simulation

7.) Test Cases: ring rotating in its own plane, square loop, point charge
    tweaking initial parameters like mass and incident velocity,
    plotting energy over time to make sure that the magnetic field does no work
